# hello-world
Short description about my first repository
This is the end of my first week in isolation. So far I need eggs and oat milk, but I have food and toilet paper so I feel as if I should stay inside some more. More than anything I want to bake focaccia... but my main issue is if I bake it, I will eat it. ALL. #struggs.
